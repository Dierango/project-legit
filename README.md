Fighting Counterfeit Products with Blockchain Technology
Project Legit is a blockchain-based solution that helps consumers verify the authenticity of products they purchase. Using the power of Stellar/Soroban blockchain, we create an immutable record of each product from the moment it leaves the manufacturer's facility until it reaches the end consumer.
